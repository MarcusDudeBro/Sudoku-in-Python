# Sudoku in Python
A sudoku game made in python using the pygame library. Randomly generates solvable sudoku puzzles whilst being timed.

### About
To make this game, I implemented and used data structures while also focusing a bit more on using the functional
programming paradigm orginally. With version 2, I decided to switch to an object oriented design implementing the gameboard and game class. It still uses a tree to randomly generate a sudoku puzzle.

## How to run
1. Download the files from this github repository
2. Unzip if necessary
3. run main.py

## How to play
To write numbers onto squares, first click on the square that you want to write the number to. A red box should outline
the clicked square. Enter whatever number you want into the box. To erase a number
you can either use the backspace key or type in 0. Bolded numbers cannot be deleted as they are they are part of
the puzzle. Mistakes are highlighted in yellow. You can save the current game you're playing by pressing the
"save game" button, then load it back up in the menu. You can also clear all your written numbers with the clear button.
